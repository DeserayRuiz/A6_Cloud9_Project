This text documents the breakdowns and times the writer ran into a wall attempting to walk through the Django tutorial on a cloud9 platform

The tutorial:  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/

1.  python manage.py runserver
  - This was the first command that gave me trouble.  After trying to run this, I was to open my web browser and go to
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/  However, after pasting the link in the browser, it failed to open the page.  At least an hour was spent     
  attempting to debug this situation.

  under the readme file when I started the django tutorial it tells you that, incase you want to run django in the terminal to 
   $ python manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT
   This worked, I clicked the link provided and then was able to see the html page mentioned in the tutorial.  
   
2.  The next issue came in writing the first view to the django app.  There were several instructions about how to write new python
  files and to link those files up to eachtother.  Once again you were told to run this command:  python manage.py runserver
  So I wised up and ran the command that worked the last time: python manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT   however this time after attempting
  to open the page, it now was a broken link.  So another long spurt of attempting to debug.  Finally, it was careful reading of the 
  instructions that I realized you simply weren't opening the same page, but opening an extension of that page..
  http://localhost:8000/polls/     
  That /polls had to be added to the linked URL given by the command line.  Case two solved.  
  
3.  The next big issue was getting the database setup.  Again, we had to modify a python file, and then edit a python settings file. 
  I swear I had copy pasted every command and bit of code correctly but I was not getting my results to match the tutorial's output.  
  Finally, something happened, though I'm unsure of what, the code worked and vuahlah, I got the desired response.  It is unclear to
  me exactly what solved this issue.
