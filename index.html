<h1>A Basic Tutorial is not so easy</h1>

<p> 
This page is meant to both document a user's experience with the Django tutorial and to offer solutions to others going through a similar experience.  
</p>

<h2>Let's Get Started with Python and Django!</h2>
<p> Execute these following steps to create you first Django and Python App! <P>
<ol>
<li> Sign up for a basic free Cloud 9 account </li>
<li> Create a workspace.  You can name the workspace whatever you'd like and give it whatever description you'd like.  The important part while creating a workspace is to choose the Django template. Once you've filled out the appropriate fields and selected the Django Template, click the create workspace button at the bottom of the page.   </li>
<li> At the bottom of your new Cloud 9 workspace is a tab that says bash which is followed by so other text.  Click into this and type the following...   django-admin startproject project  .  You can name your project whatever you'd like.  The name of your project will take the place of 'project' in the given command.  You have now created the template of you Django and Python application.  </ol>

<h2>What is Django and why should Developers be aware of it?</h2>

<p>
A paragraph about what Django is and why it's pertinent to the students of ITC134.  
</p>

<h3>How does python fit into the big picture?</h3>

<p> Python is a coding language.  It is pertinent to Developers for several reasons.  There will be reasons why ITC134 students ought to care and what ITC134 students should know about Python.  Perhaps we could even mention simple steps for how to get started with Python.
