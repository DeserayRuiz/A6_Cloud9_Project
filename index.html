<h1>A Basic Tutorial is not so easy</h1>

<p> 
This page is meant to both document a user's experience with the Django tutorial and to offer solutions to others going through a similar experience.  
</p>

<h2>What is Django and why should Developers be aware of it?</h2>

<p>
A paragraph about what Django is and why it's pertinent to the students of ITC134.  
</p>

<h3>How does python fit into the big picture?</h3>

<p> Python is a coding language.  It is pertinent to Developers for several reasons.  There will be reasons why ITC134 students ought to care and what ITC134 students should know about Python.  Perhaps we could even mention simple steps for how to get started with Python.
